                            <p><i> My name is Tonya Mcallister I'm a mother of four kids
                                    & grandkids as well. I reached a point in my life looking to
                                    change my career. I was inspired by an individual whom was more concerned
                                    about helping and educating his people. He lost his life behind(Prolific
                                    quote: To inspire is the most courageous act...) With only one child left and
                                    adopting my grandson. I moved to Denver, CO beautiful giving me a chance to
                                    catch my breath & think about life. Next I moved to Las Vegas I hated it too
                                    much partying. Still working on my bucket list want to jump from Stratoshere Hotel
                                    and was all suited up and strapped in looked over the ledge and decided no
                                    this is not for me. I will stick to Scuba Diving in my next adventure.</i></p>
